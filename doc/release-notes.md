# {{sim_name}} - Release Notes
<!-- 
Instructions:
* Replace {{sim_name}} with the simulation name.
* Replace YYYY-MM-DD with date in year-month-day format.
* Make sure version numbers are correct, in MAJOR.MINOR format, e.g. 1.2
* For a 1.0 release, only the 1.0 heading and date is needed. 
* Developer and designer should collaborate on what to include for any release beyond 1.0. 
* For each new MAJOR.MINOR version, add a section to the top of the doc - reverse chronological order, with the most-recent version at the top.

For an exemplar, see https://github.com/phetsims/balancing-chemical-equations/blob/main/doc/release-notes.md
