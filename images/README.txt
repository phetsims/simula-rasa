Image files belong in this directory. Each image must have an entry in license.json which indicates the origin of the
image as well as its licensing.  If this directory has subdirectories, each subdirectory mut have its own license.json 
file.  

The license.json file should contains one entry per file, and each should be annotated with the following:

* text - copyright statement or "Public Domain"
* projectURL - the URL for the resource
* license - the name of license, such as "Public Domain"
* notes - additional helpful information about the resource, or ""

For an example, please see any of the license.json files in a PhET simulation's image directory.
